# Us-Citizenship-Quiz
## Description

I made a short and easy five question quiz on US Citizenship. I got the questions from the official citizenship and made them a bit funny. I learned I need to be more descriptive with my names and have better organization. I also learned a lot about javascript and how to create and style html elements within javascript.
